### Hi there 👋

I am Wayne, currently pursuing Master's degree in Computer Science at SMU. 

#### About Me
After working for several years, I have returned to academia, driven by my passion for learning the latest computer technologies. I have a keen interest in development areas such as machine learning, web/mobile applications, GIS, and embedded systems, and I am proficient in multiple programming languages. This is my [personal website](https://www.waynej.me), where I will showcase my recent work.
